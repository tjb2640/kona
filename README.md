# Kona

More experiments in sandboxing

## Todo

- Click to spawn a Kona chip entity with boilerplate lua code
- Add a code editor and give it some spawnmenu real estate
- Left click chip to update its source code
- Right click chip to edit its source code
- Populate the vanilla environment beyond `print`
- Add support for Wiremod in+out
- Get duplicator save table to preserve chip info/source code
- Evaluate performance figures, determine good default limits (with or without JIT enabled)
- Add configuration options

Some nice-to-haves
- Consider restricting some functions to specific ranks
